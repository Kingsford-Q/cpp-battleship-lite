# C++ Terminal Battleship Game

A simple terminal-based game where the player tries to hit 4 hidden ships on a 4x4 grid. Built in C++ for fun and practice.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works
- The player chooses a row and column (1â€“4)
- If a ship is at that location, it's a hit
- You win when youâ€™ve hit all 4 ships

## ðŸ”§ Concepts Used
- 2D arrays
- Game loops
- Input handling
- Basic win conditions

## ðŸš€ How to Run
- Compile in Code::Blocks or any C++ compiler
- Run from terminal
- Enter numbers when prompted

## ðŸ’¡ Improvements to Make
- Add input validation (prevent crashing on bad input)
- Hide the ship positions (random placement)
- Add score or turn limits
- Better visuals (e.g., draw the grid)
